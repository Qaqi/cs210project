Throughout the project, we will analyze the data sets whose links are provided at the end of the page.
One of the data set is acquired from IGN which is one the leading ‘games and entertainment media’
company. It contains more than 18.000 rows with the columns such as game title, release date, IGN
score, genre, platform. Other data set is acquired from VGChartz, a video game sales tracking website,
which contains over 16.000 rows game sales data with columns like title, release year, platform,
publisher and regional sales (North America, Europe or Japan). Data on both sources coincide with
each other in terms of games’ release dates, from 1996 to 2016.

## Aim
Our aim is to find some correlation between the IGN ratings and global sales of video games
according to VGChartz. However, we are also planning to analyze interesting relations between
genres, years and sales. One such idea is to search for a relation among the games that IGN had rated
with low ratings but had successful sales
